### MMEDS User Guide ###

The format for the metadata file is as follows.
See example_metadata.tsv
The first row of the metadata file specifies the entity the metadata pertains
to (i.e. the table in the database the information will be stored in).The
second row specifies the specific property (This is akin to a tradional metadata
header column). The third row specifies if this column is required for every sample.
The fourth row specifies the data-type and the fifth row specifies the unit/format of the data.
These rows are the header of the metadata file, the following rows should
each contain all the information relating to a particular sample.

For Example:
The column
============
1:	Subjects
2:	Height
3:	Optional
4:	Number
5:	Meters

This column should contain the height in meters of the subject the
sample described in this row was taken from.

Not every metadata column will be relevant to every study. If the metadata
doesn't exist for an optional column it should be filled in with 'NA' not
'na', 'n.a.', 'N/A' or any other Not Available indicator. DO NOT delete
the columns from the metadata template.

If metadata exists that does not fit into any of the default columns
additional columns may be added. Their format should be as follows

For Example:
1:	AdditionalMetaData
2:	(Name of the metadata column)
3:	Optional
4:	(Type of the metadata: Text, Number, Date, Time, etc)
5:	(Unit of the metadata: If applicable)

This metadata will be stored separately from the default columns so
possible analysis based on these columns may be limited.


Certain terms in our metadata may be used differently in others contexts.
For reference we define them as follows:

Intervention: Any procedure, medication, or other type of treatment
              performed on a subject.
Specimen: The initial material collected prior to any analysis.
Aliquot: Any sub-divisions of the initial specimen.
Sample: The result of processing an aliquot through some type of
        wet lab procedure.
RawData: The result of sequencing a sample. Typically this is the stage
        we will receive the data and accompanying metadata.
Result: The final result of running a computational tool (such as Qiime)
        on RawData. This will typically be generated by MMEDS and so it
        may be left blank.


For all fields entries should contain no special characters '$', '*', ';', etc.
Metadata files containing entries with these characters cannot be uploaded to the server.
All text fields will be converted to lowercase for storage in the database
so be sure none of the entries are case sensitive.

Certain Fields will only accept values that fall into certain categories.
They are as follows:

RawDataID:
    - This is the unique identifier for each sample that has already gone through sequencing
    - Equivalent to #SampleID when using qiime
    - If the reads are demultiplexed the file names should follow the format
        - {RawDataID}_{AdditionalInformation}_R1_001.fastq.gz
        - E.G.
            - Forward Read: S33_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz
            - Reverse Read: S33_L001_R2_001.fastq.gz
SpecimenBodySite & SpecimenType:
https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/uberon
    - Values should be taken from UBERON, using the terms as provided on the website
    - The UBERON ID should be included in their respective UberonCode columns
Ethnicity:
Categories taken from NIH standards.
https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/not-od-15-089.html
    - American Indian or Alaska Native
    - Asian
    - Black or African American
    - Hispanic or Latino
    - Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander
    - White
    Note: One subject may have multiple ethnicities. Include each in a
        separate row. It is acceptable to duplicate other information
        for this purpose.
Sex:
    - Male
    - Female
    - Transgender Male
    - Transgender Female
    Note: For someone to qualify as Transgender they must have undergone
        some procedure or received some medication such as hormone therapy.
        Please include this information under 'Intervention' if known.
ICDCode:
    - Illnesses should be classified by ICD 10 code and recorded in this column
    - If the subject is known to be healthy use the code XXX.XXXX
    - If the subject's health status is unknown enter "NA"
    - All codes must contain all seven digits + the decimal. Fill empty digits with 'X'
        - E.G. K55.5 -> K55.5XXX
    - If only part of the code is known fill in the rest with 'X'
        - E.G. K45 -> K45.XXXX
    - If the subject is an animal use the code for a human subject that most closely
        resembles its condition
Intervention:
    - InterventionTypes include:
        - Medication
        - Surgery
        - Physical Therapy
        - Environmental
        - Other
    - Treatments should include the NCD code if it is a drug or CPT
        code for a surgical procedure.
    - If the treatment does not have a code under these codes such as
        a dietary intervention the intervention should be described well
        enough to be reproducible.
