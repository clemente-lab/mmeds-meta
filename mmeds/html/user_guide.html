        <h2 class='w3-container'> 1) Overview </h2>
        <p>
        The metadata for mmeds is split into two files. Subject metadata and specimen metadata.
        Both follow the same format. The column ('AdditionalMetaData', 'SubjectIdCol') in the
        specimen metadata must match the value in ('Subjects', 'HostSubjectId') in the subject
        metadata for the specimen to be linked to that particular subject.
        </p>

        <p>
        The reason they are split into separate files is to allow multiple rows of subject information,
        illnesses, treatments (interventions), etc without having to fill out all those rows with
        duplicate information for each specimen.
        </p>

        <p>
        The first row of the metadata file specifies the entity the metadata pertains
        to (i.e. the table in the database the information will be stored in).The
        second row specifies the specific property (This is akin to a traditional metadata
        header column). The third row specifies if this column is required for every sample.
        The fourth row specifies the data-type and the fifth row specifies the unit/format of the data.
        These rows are the header of the metadata file, the following rows should
        each contain all the information relating to a particular sample.
        </p>

        <p>
        For Example:
        <ul class="w3-ul">
            <li>1:	Subjects</li>
            <li>2:	Height</li>
            <li>3:	Optional</li>
            <li>4:	Number</li>
            <li>5:	Meters</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
        This column should contain the height in meters of the subject the
        sample described in this row was taken from.

        To create a template to fill with your metadata delete all rows after
        the first five in example metadata files provided (or a copy if you want
        to use them for reference).
        </p>

        <h2 class='w3-container'> 2) Study Specific Metadata </h2>

        <p>
        Not every metadata column will be relevant to every study. If the metadata
        doesn't exist for an optional column it should be filled in with 'NA' not
        'na', 'n.a.', 'N/A' or any other Not Available indicator. DO NOT delete
        the columns from the metadata template.
        </p>

        <p>
        If metadata exists that does not fit into any of the default columns
        additional columns may be added. Their format should be as follows
        </p>

        <p>
        <h4>For Example: </h4>
        <ul class="w3-ul">
            <li>1:	AdditionalMetaData</li>
            <li>2:	(Name of the metadata column)</li>
            <li>3:	Optional</li>
            <li>4:	(Type of the metadata: Text, Number, Date, Time, etc)</li>
            <li>5:	(Unit of the metadata: If applicable)</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
        This metadata will be stored separately from the default columns so
        possible analysis based on these columns may be limited.

        <h2 class='w3-container'> 3) Term Definitions </h2>
        <p>
        Certain terms in our metadata may be used differently in others contexts.
        For reference we define them as follows:

        <ul class="w3-ul">

            <li><b>Intervention</b>: Any procedure, medication, or other type of treatment
                performed on a subject.</li>
            <li><b>Specimen</b>: The initial material collected prior to any analysis.</li>
            <li><b>Aliquot</b>: Any sub-divisions of the initial specimen.</li>
            <li><b>Sample</b>: The result of processing an aliquot through some type of
                wet lab procedure.</li>
            <li><b>RawData</b>: The result of sequencing a sample. Typically this is the stage
                we will receive the data and accompanying metadata.</li>
            <li><b>Result</b>: The final result of running a computational tool (such as Qiime)
                on RawData. This will typically be generated by MMEDS and so it
                may be left blank.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>


        <p>
        For all fields entries should contain no special characters '$', '*', ';', etc.
        Metadata files containing entries with these characters cannot be uploaded to the server.
        All text fields will be converted to lowercase for storage in the database
        so be sure none of the entries are case sensitive.
