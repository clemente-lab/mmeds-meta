        <h2 class='w3-blue w3-center'> Overview </h2>
        <p>
        ** Gotta plug MMEDs, probably you'll want to edit it**
        **MMEDs is super cool data warehouse for metagenomic data, and associated metadata.
        To facilitate meta-analysis MMEDs has a standardized metadata format that all submissions must follow.
        In this user guide, we'll go over submission requirements for MMEDs:**

        <p>
        Metadata for MMEDs submissions is split into two files named subject metadata and specimen metadata.
        Having the metadata in separate files allows for multiple rows of subject information,
        illnesses, treatments (interventions), etc without having to fill out all those rows with
        duplicate information for each specimen.
        </p>

        <p>
        **
        Both **metadata files** follow the same format. **what does this mean? what is the format? Either leave out or provide more detail **
        The column  **columns?** ('AdditionalMetaData', 'SubjectIdCol') in the
        specimen metadata must match the value in ('Subjects', 'HostSubjectId') in the subject
        metadata in order for the specimen to be linked to that particular subject.
        </p>

        <p>
        ** Edited, but not sure exactly what was meant by entity. I mean I kinda know but not 100% on the language**
        The first row of the metadata file specifies an entity that represents
        the table in the database the information will be stored in. The
        second row specifies the property being measured (This is akin to a traditional metadata
        header column). The third row specifies if this column is required for every sample.
        The fourth row specifies the data-type and the fifth row specifies the unit/format of the data.
        These rows are the header of the metadata file, the following rows should
        each contain all the information relating to a particular sample.
        </p>

        <p>
        For Example:
        <ul class="w3-ul">
            <li>1:	Subjects</li>
            <li>2:	Height</li>
            <li>3:	Optional</li>
            <li>4:	Number</li>
            <li>5:	Meters</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
        This column should contain the subject's height in meters for the associated sample.

        To create a template to fill with your metadata, you can delete all rows after
        the first five in example metadata files provided (or a copy if you want
        to use them for reference).

        <h2 class='w3-purple w3-center'> Study Specific Metadata </h2>

        <p>
        Some metadata columns may not be relevant to a given study. If the metadata
        doesn't exist for an optional column it should be filled in with 'NA' not
        'na', 'n.a.', 'N/A' or any other Not Available indicator. DO NOT delete
        the columns from the metadata template.
        </p>

        <p>
        If metadata exists that does not fit into any of the default columns,
        additional columns may be added. The format should be as follows:
        </p>

        <p>
        <h4>For Example: </h4>
        <ul class="w3-ul">
            <li>1:	AdditionalMetaData</li>
            <li>2:	(Name of the metadata column)</li>
            <li>3:	Optional</li>
            <li>4:	(Type of the metadata: Text, Number, Date, Time, etc)</li>
            <li>5:	(Unit of the metadata: If applicable)</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
        This optional metadata is stored separately from the default columns so
        analysis based on these columns may be limited.
        </p>

        <h2 class='w3-pink w3-center'> Term Definitions </h2>
        <p>
        Certain terms in our metadata may be used differently in others contexts.
        For reference we define them as follows:

        <ul class="w3-ul">

            <li><b>Intervention</b>: Any procedure, medication, or other type of treatment
                performed on a subject.</li>
            <li><b>Specimen</b>: The initial material collected prior to any analysis.</li>
            <li><b>Aliquot</b>: Any sub-divisions of the initial specimen.</li>
            <li><b>Sample</b>: The result of processing an aliquot through some type of
                wet lab procedure.</li>
            <li><b>RawData</b>: The result of sequencing a sample. Typically this is the stage
                we will receive the data and accompanying metadata.</li>
            <li><b>Result</b>: The final result of running a computational tool (such as Qiime)
                on RawData. This will typically be generated by MMEDS and so it
                may be left blank.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
        Metadata field entries should not contain special characters '$', '*', ';', etc.
        Metadata files containing entries with these characters cannot be uploaded to the server.
        All text fields will be converted to lowercase when stored in the database,
        so make sure none of the entries are case sensitive.
        </p>

    <div class="w3-container w3-card-4 w3-white">
        <h2 class='w3-purple w3-center'> Protocol vs. Protocols </h2>
        <p>
        As you may have noticed there are several columns with similar names.
        Such as SampleProtocol and SampleProtocols, SpecimenProtocol and SpecimenProtocols, etc.
        These refer to the methods used to produce a particular Specimen, Aliquot, etc.
        For example, a particular Sample, the 'SampleProtocols' columns
        in the same row refer to the standard procedure, such as FACS sorting, used to create this
        Sample from the associated Aliquot. SampleProtocol contains information related to that
        particular run of FACS sorting. This includes, when was it performed, who performed it and if there was anything
        unusual about the sorting in this run. Similarly RawDataProtocols refer
        to general methods for processing Samples into RawData, such as Illumina MiSeq. For example, RawDataProtocol
        refers to a particular instance of running Illumina MiSeq.
