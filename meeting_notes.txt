**Internal to mount sinai we can link accounts to sinai accounts

to use it externally we would need to handle account authentication

Make sureit's known which use is 

start with a 1TB base directory in /orga/projects/

chrons at reboot

They will host the web server that will redirect to my server

GPFS backend

Setup MongoDB 

They will create a group account for the server
sudo based account

Put a request in for a 1TB project dir for this new account.

Consider having other local services that run the jobs and the web server looks for completion status

Make sure that the server internally validates that all jobs submitted run through to completion
Run chronjob check how much time is left in the account

submit and hol and get a stat for it to make sure all is well

ifirst ticket, request allocation account, 

website

alloocation request
put jose's and my names on the requestc


Earth microbiome project - GIthub repo published in nature

American Gut - Msystems
===========================================
Analysis Summary

Rotate labels for OTU plot. Use theme.element.text (Angle = 90)  

Sort the samples so they correspond to metadata catagories. 

Have taxa summarized by group rather than just per sample. Use averages from each samples 

Default of 1000 reads for filtering
Add a warning message about 'this many samples were filtered out'

open issue on control and contaminants

Have settings for different pipelines, remove nothing, remove all contaminants, etc... 
 
Add a config file for the analysis

in time Add source tracker, american gut, earth microbiome

Set max number of columns for taxa summary legends so they aren't cutoff

Add legend for groups to every plot where it would be relevant

Have a template for the text 'Alpha diversity using metric (chao1) , also text for 
what the plot represents. Indicate the number of samples. Basically auto
generate all the info necessary for the caption of the figure

Allow user to upload a particular list of variables.
By default create graphs where each sample is plotted individually. 

Add shannon for alpha div for qiime1

Add to title/caption what variable is used for grouping

Should be able to read plot text from a print out 

ggrepel - Add sample labels to each dot in a separate plot

Have an option for using continuous colors for particular variables


++++++++++++++++++++ Analysis Notes ++++++++++++++++++++++

Reached end of index-reads file before iterating through joined paired-end-reads file! Except for missing paired-end reads that did not survive assembly, your index and paired-end reads files must be in the same order! Also, check that the index-reads and paired-end reads have identical headers.
The last joined paired-end ID processed was: 'MISEQ02:463:000000000-BY5Y5:1:1101:15318:1516 1:N:0:'
qiime.org: Use search on that page.
Issue likely with last part '1:N:0:' on reverse is '2:N:0'

metabolite data, where?
Store as a seperate data file
metabolomics, RNAseq, and high throughput assay

make the way datafiles are stored and accessed more
generic to allow running analysis on different files.

How do we monitor who uploads what? What if fake data is uploaded to gain access
to the public metadata/data?

In kevin's data, many samples with not enough sequencing depth to pass rarefaction
filter.

why truncating with dada2? is the endo f the read of lower quality?
check lengthof the data before dada2. COmpare moving pictures / enrica

Can be automated for our lab's data
Create default parameters for other setups
