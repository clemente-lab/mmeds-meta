### MMEDS User Guide ###

The format for the metadata file is as follows.
See example_metadata.tsv
The first row of the metadata file specifies the entity the metadata pertains
to. The second row specifies the specific property. The third row specifies
if this column is required for every sample. The fourht row specifies the
datatype and the fifth row specifies the unit/format of the data.
These rows are the header of the metadata file, the following rows should
each contain all the information relating to a particular sample.

For Example:
1:	Subjects
2:	Height
3:	Optional
4:	Number
5:	Meters

This column should contain the height in meters of the subject the
sample described in this row was taken from.

If the metadata doesn't exist for an optional column it should be filled in
with 'NA'. If metadata exists that does not fit into any of the default columns
additional columns may be added. Their format should be as follows

For Example:
1:	AdditionalMetaData
2:	(Name of the metadata)
3:	Optional
4:	(Type of the metadata: Text, Number, Date, Time, etc)
5:	(Unit of the metadata: If applicable)

This metadata will be stored seperately from the default columns so
possible analysis based on these columns may be limited.


Certain terms in our metadata may be used differently in others contexts.
For reference we define them as follows:

Intervention: Any procedure, medication, or other type of treatment
              performed on a subject.
Specimen: The initial material collected prior to any analysis.
Aliquot: Any sub-divisions of the inital specimen.
Sample: The result of processing an aliquot through some type of
        wet lab procedure.
RawData: The result of sequencing a sample.
Result: The final result of running a computational tool (such as Qiime)
        on RawData.
